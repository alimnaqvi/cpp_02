# C++ Module 02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical class form

This is a 42 school project. This module focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, function overloading, and orthodox canonical classes in C++.

Concepts learned and applied:
- Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
  - Learning OCF and basic concept / initial setup for fixed point numbers
- Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
  - Learning the arithmetic for conversion from float to fixed point and vice versa
  - Overloading the insertion operator
- Exercise 02: Now weâ€™re talking
  - Overloading operators using member functions
  - Learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of fixed point numbers
  - Learning the inner workings of pre-/post-increment/decrement operators by overloading them for fixed point numbers (to increment/decrement by machine epsilon)
- Exercise 03: BSP
  - Programming with points in 2D space
  - Cross product / signed area approach to determining the orientation of 2D vectors
  - Importance of const correctness in classes, especially for overloaded operators
